This MIPS program allows users to play sudoku. Given a variety of puzzles of varying difficulties, players can choose which to play. These options are sourced from text files, read through a buffer into the gameâ€™s memory, and are formatted properly before being displayed. To run, open project.asm using MARS MIPS Assembler jar file within the same folder as the text files, assemble, and run.
